## 🌐 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think, reason, and learn. AI systems can analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## 🤖 Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.


**Example use cases:**
- Predicting stock prices
- Spam email detection
- Recommender systems (like Netflix, YouTube, etc.)

## 🧠 Deep Learning (DL)
Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). It excels in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.


**Example use cases:**
- Self-driving cars
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Medical image analysis
