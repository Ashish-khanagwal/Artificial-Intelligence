Today began on a lazy note. My alarm went off, but my bed was far too convincing—I gave in and stayed a little longer. Honestly, those extra ten minutes felt like stolen treasure.

The morning was filled with scheduled tasks, but there was one highlight: the first sip of hot tea. Somehow, it tasted better than usual, almost like it knew I needed the energy to kick off the week.

Work had its ups and downs. A couple of things didn’t go as planned, and for a moment, I felt the frustration creep in. But then I reminded myself—it’s just a Monday, it’s not supposed to be perfect. That thought alone eased the pressure.

In the afternoon, I heard a funny conversation between two kids arguing about who could run faster—neither actually ran, but both claimed victory. Their confidence made me laugh and wonder why adults complicate things so much.

Evening arrived with a soft breeze. I took a short walk and let my thoughts wander. The street was buzzing with small life—vendors setting up, people chatting, someone playing an old song on the radio. It was like a hundred tiny stories happening at once.

Now, as I wind down, I feel strangely calm. Mondays usually carry a heavy weight, but today felt lighter—like a reminder that not every beginning has to be hard.
