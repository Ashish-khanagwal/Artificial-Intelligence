<h1 align=center>ENCAPSULATION</h1>

### What is Encapsulation?

- Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.
- It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps protect the object's internal state from accidental or unauthorized modification.
- Think of it like a protective barrier around the data to ensure it is used safely and as intended.

### Key Terminologies in Encapsulation

1.  Class
    - Blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior.

2.  Object
    - An instance of a class containing data and methods.

3.  Attributes (Data Members)
    - Variables that hold the object's state (data).

4.  Methods (Member Functions)
    - Functions defined inside a class that operate on the object's data.

5.  Access Modifiers - Control visibility of attributes and methods:
    - **Public:** Accessible from anywhere.
    - **Protected:** Intended for internal use (single underscore prefix).
    - **Private:** Restricted to the class only (double underscore prefix).

6.  Benefits of Encapsulation
    - Protect data from accidental corruption.
    - Hide implementation details from the user.
    - Ease of maintenance and enhancement.
    - Control over how data is accessed or modified (e.g., through setters/getters with validation).
