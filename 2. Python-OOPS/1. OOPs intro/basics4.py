"""
Static Attributes -
1. Static attributes (also called class variables) are variables defined inside a class but outside any instance methods.
2. These attributes are shared by all instances of the class.
3. They belong to the class itself, not to any individual object.

Usecase -
1. When you want to share data or state common to all instances.
2. Save memory â€” instead of each instance storing its own copy, all share one variable.
3. Useful for constants or counters that track data globally across instances.
