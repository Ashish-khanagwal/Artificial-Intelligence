"""
Static Method :
- A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class.
- It does not receive the implicit first argument self (instance) or cls (class).
- Static methods behave like regular functions but belong to the class's namespace.
- They cannot modify object state or class state.
- Used as utility functions related to the class but not dependent on instance or class data.

Use the @staticmethod decorator before the method definition.

"""
When to Use Static Methods?
- When the method performs a task that is related to the class but does not modify or require instance/class 
information.

- Examples: helper functions, utility functions, formatting, calculations, validations that donâ€™t rely on 
object data.
